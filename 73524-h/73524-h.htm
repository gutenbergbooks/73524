<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>Recent advances in the arts make it possible to illustrate books at much less
cost than formerly. An important invention is the process of printing in three
colors from half-tone plates. The author of this manual was one of the first to use
this process in illustrating a work upon the lepidoptera. When “The Butterfly
Book” appeared he received letters from many scientific friends expressing their
wonder. Among those who wrote to him was Dr. Samuel Hubbard Scudder, the
Nestor among American lepidopterists, who has since passed away. He said: “I
am simply astonished at the fidelity to nature displayed by the plates in your book,
and at the low price at which the new process permits it to be sold.”</p>

<p>That “The Butterfly Book” met a real need is shown by the fact that more
than thirty thousand copies have already found purchasers. It is, however, a
biggish book. The publishers, Messrs. Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., have asked me to
get up a little pocket manual of the butterflies, similar in form to the “Flower
Guide,” which has been most cordially received by the public. I have therefore
prepared the following pages, to which in the gracious phrase of our forefathers I
now “invite the attention of the gentle reader.”</p>

<p>There are more than six hundred species of butterflies found in North America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
north of the Gulf of Mexico and the Rio Grande. Most of these are figured in
“The Butterfly Book.” In this manual two hundred and fifty-five species and
varieties are depicted in their natural colors. They are mainly the commoner
forms, which occur in the more densely inhabited parts of the United States and
Canada. I have, however, included numerous forms from the Southern States,
and not a few of the more showy species from the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>In some cases only half of the insect is shown. “Half a loaf is better than no
bread.” In some cases only one side of the wings is delineated. Usually this is
sufficient for identification. The inhabitants of this earth have never seen but one
side of the moon, but they know it when they see it, unless they be like the tipsy
pair, one of whom said to the other, who was leaning against a lamp post, “Friend,
is that the moon, or a lamp?” and who received the reply: “Don’t ask me, I’m a
stranger myself in these parts.” By showing only one half, or one side, of a species
I have been able to illustrate many more than I could otherwise have done.</p>

<p>The figures of some of the larger species have been slightly reduced to accommodate
them to the page, but as the natural size is always given in the description
the student need not be perplexed.</p>

<p>The author hopes that his readers will have as much pleasure in studying the
winged fairies of the woods and the fields as he has had in preparing this small
pocket guide for their assistance.</p>

<h3><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: TEE">THE</ins> PLACE OF BUTTERFLIES IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM</h3>


<p>The Animal Kingdom is divided into various  <em>subkingdoms</em>. One of these is
the subkingdom of the  <i lang="la">Arthropoda</i>. This word is derived from the Greek nouns
ἄρθρον (<i lang="grc">arthron</i>) meaning  <em>joint</em>, and πούς (<i lang="grc">pous</i>) meaning  <em>foot</em>. The  <i lang="la">Arthropoda</i>
are animals the bodies of which are made up of a series of rings or segments jointed
together, and the other organs of which are likewise composed of tubular bodies
similarly united. All arthropods are  <em>invertebrates</em>; that is to say, they do not have
backbones and internal skeletons, such as are possessed by fishes, reptiles, birds,
and mammals, including man. Vertebrate animals have  <em>endoskeletons</em>, “inside
skeletons.” In a ham, for instance, the bone is internal to the muscular parts,
or meat, and lies near the middle. The muscles of a man clothe his bones. In the
arthropods, on the contrary, the hard parts clothe the muscles. Arthropods are
therefore said to have  <em>exoskeletons</em>, “outside skeletons.” The body, the legs, and
other organs of an insect or a crab consist of a series of hollow tubes held together
by flexible skin at the points of union, and controlled in their movements by muscles
which pull from the inside. The meat of a lobster is inside of the shell, or exoskeleton,
as everybody who has eaten a lobster knows. The arrangement is exactly
the reverse of that which we find in the vertebrates.</p>

<p>The subkingdom of the  <i lang="la">Arthropoda</i> is divided into six  <em>classes</em>, one of which consists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of the  <i lang="la">Insecta</i> (insects). It is estimated that there are three and a half millions
of species of insects upon the globe, not to speak of the vast number of species
which are now extinct, and known only by their fossil remains.</p>

<p>The Class  <i lang="la">Insecta</i> is subdivided into many  <em>Orders</em>. To attempt even to briefly
speak of all these orders would take more space than the publisher has allotted to
the author, and it is enough to say that butterflies belong to the order  <i lang="la">Lepidoptera</i>.
The lepidoptera are divided into two  <em>Suborders</em>: the  <i lang="la">Rhopalocera</i>, or Butterflies, and
the  <i lang="la">Heterocera</i>, or Moths. Both are characterized by having scaly wings, hence
the name, which is derived from the Greek words λεπὶς (<i lang="grc">lepis</i>) meaning  <em>scale</em>, and
πτερὸν (<i lang="grc">pteron</i>) meaning  <em>wing</em>. Lepidoptera are “scale-winged insects.” Any one
who has ever handled a butterfly or moth, must have noticed upon his fingers a
dust-like substance, rubbed off from the wings of the captured insect. Upon examining
this substance under a microscope it is seen to be composed of minute
scales (see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Fig. <i>a</i>), and upon looking at the wing of a butterfly under a magnifying
glass it is seen to be covered with such scales, arranged somewhat as the scales
upon the sides of a fish, or as the shingles upon the roof of a house (see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Fig.
<i>b</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>Butterflies are mainly diurnal in their habits, preferring the sunshine. Moths
on the other hand are nocturnal, and fly in the dusk, or after dark. Butterflies are
therefore often called  <i lang="la">diurnal lepidoptera</i>, and moths are spoken of as  <i lang="la">nocturnal
lepidoptera</i>. There are, however, a few butterflies which fly at dusk, and there are
many moths which are diurnal in their habits. Such moths are generally gay in
color, and for the most part inhabit tropical countries, although we have a few such
species in the United States. Ordinarily the best way to distinguish between
butterflies and moths is by examining their antennæ, or “feelers,” as they are
sometimes incorrectly called. In the case of butterflies the antennæ are thread-like,
terminating in a small  <em>knob-like</em>, or  <em>club-like</em> enlargement. It is this fact which has
led naturalists to call them  <i lang="la">Rhopalocera</i>. The word is derived from the Greek
nouns ῥώπαλον (<i lang="grc">rhopalon</i>) meaning a  <em>club</em>, and κέρας (<i lang="grc">keras</i>) a  <em>horn</em>.
 <em>Butterflies are
lepidoptera having at the end of their antennæ clubs, which are sometimes short, long,
or hooked</em> (see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Figs. <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>.) The forms assumed by the antennæ of moths
are very various. The moths are therefore known as  <i lang="la">Heterocera</i>, the word being
compounded from the Greek adjective ἕτερος ( <em>all sorts</em>) and the noun κέρας (<i lang="grc">keras</i>)
a  <em>horn</em>.  <em>Moths are lepidoptera having all sorts of antennæ, except such as are club-shaped
at their ends.</em> However there is no rule without its exceptions, and there
are a few rare moths in tropical lands which have club-shaped antennæ like butterflies,
but none of these occur in the region with which this book deals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>


<h3>THE ANATOMY OF BUTTERFLIES</h3>

<p>The body of a butterfly consists of the head, the thorax, and the abdomen
(see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Fig. <i>c</i>).</p>

<p>The head carries two relatively large eyes, one on either side. The eyes of
insects are compound, and if examined under a microscope are seen to have a multitude
of minute facets, which serve to gather the light from all directions, so that
butterflies can look forward and backward, upward and downward, as well as outward,
all at one time. Between the eyes on the upper part of the head arise the
antennæ, of which we have already spoken. The precise function of these organs
in insects has been the subject of much discussion. Supposed by some to be ears, by
others to be the seat of the sense of smell, by others to combine within themselves
these two senses, and by still others to represent a sense which is not possessed
by vertebrate animals, their use in the life of insects is not yet clearly understood.
The weight of evidence seems to be in favor of the view that they are organs
of smell, and it is now quite firmly established by experiment that the organs
of hearing in insects are represented by certain pores and openings on their legs.
In front between the eyes and below the antennæ are two little organs, each composed
of three joints, which are known as the  <i lang="la">labial palpi</i> (see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Fig. <i>e</i>).
Between these, coiled up like a watch-spring, is the proboscis, with which the butterfly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
sucks up the nectar from flowers or drinks water from moist places (see
<a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Figs. <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>). We have not the space in this little manual to go more
deeply into the anatomy of these organs, but enough has been said to enable the
beginner to recognize the various parts. The student realizes that the head in
general supports the principal organs of sense and the proboscis, or mouth.</p>

<p>The thorax carries the organs of locomotion, which consist of four wings and
six feet. The thorax is made up of three segments, or rings, the foremost of which
is called the  <i lang="la">prothorax</i>, the next the  <i lang="la">mesothorax</i>, and the hindmost the  <i lang="la">metathorax</i>.
The subdivisions of the thorax are not easily distinguishable by examining the
body of a butterfly even under a microscope, because the bodies of butterflies are
generally heavily clothed with hairs and scales. In order to clearly make out the
subdivisions, which we are considering, it is necessary to take a specimen and denude
it of its scales and hairs, and even dissect it under a glass. The correctness
of the foregoing statements then becomes apparent.</p>

<p>The legs of butterflies are arranged in three pairs, the foremost of which are
known as  <em>prothoracic</em>, being attached to the prothorax; the second pair are called
 <em>mesothoracic</em>, springing, as they do, from the middle segment of the thorax; and the
last are styled  <em>metathoracic</em> legs, rising from the hindmost segment of the chest
(see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Fig. <i>c</i>). It should be noted here that in the great family of the  <i lang="la">Nymphalidæ</i>,
or “Brush-footed Butterflies,” in both sexes the anterior, or prothoracic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
pair of legs, are not fully developed, being aborted (see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Fig. <i>d</i>) and therefore
do not serve for walking; and that in the families of the  <i lang="la">Erycinidæ</i>, or “Metal-marks,”
and the  <i lang="la">Lycænidæ</i>, or “Blues and Coppers,” the females have six legs
adapted to walking, while the males possess only four ambulatory legs, the front
pair being in the latter sex aborted in these families, as in the  <i lang="la">Nymphalidæ</i>. The
legs of butterflies, like those of all other insects, consist of five parts (see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>,
Fig. <i>f</i>) the first of which, nearest the body, is called the  <em>coxa</em>, with which articulates a
small ring-like piece, known as the  <em>trochanter</em>. To the trochanter is attached the
 <em>femur</em>, and united with the latter, forming an angle with it, is the  <em>tibia</em>. The last
division of the leg is the  <em>tarsus</em>, or foot, composed of a series of joints, to the last of
which is attached a pair of claws, which in butterflies are generally rather minute,
though in other orders of insects these claws are sometimes long and powerful, this
being especially true of some beetles. The prothoracic legs of the  <i lang="la">Nymphalidæ</i> and
of the males of the  <i lang="la">Erycinidæ</i> and  <i lang="la">Lycænidæ</i> have lost the use of the tarsus, only
retaining it in feeble form, and the tibia has undergone modification. In many of
the  <i lang="la">Nymphalidæ</i> the tibia is densely clothed with long hairs, giving this part of the
leg the appearance of a brush, whence the name “Brush-footed Butterflies” (see
<a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Fig. <i>d</i>). The tibiæ are often armed with more or less strongly developed
spines.</p>

<p>The most striking parts of butterflies are their wings, which in proportion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the size of their bodies are usually very large, and which are remarkable for the
beauty of the colors and the markings which they display both on the upper and
on the under side.</p>

<p>The wings consist of a framework of horny tubes which are in reality double,
the inner tube being filled with air, the outer tube with blood. The blood of insects
is not, like that of vertebrates, red in color. It is almost colorless, or at most
slightly stained with yellow. The circulation of the blood in the outer wall of the
wing-tubes takes place most freely during the brief period in which the insect is
expanding its wings after emergence from the chrysalis, concerning which we shall
have more to say elsewhere. After the wings of the butterfly have become fully
expanded, the circulation of the blood in the wings ceases almost entirely. The
horny tubes, which compose the framework of the wings of butterflies, support
between them a delicate membrane, to which upon both the upper and lower sides
are attached the scales. The two fore wings are more or less triangular in outline;
the hind wings are also subtriangular, but are generally more or less rounded on the
outer margin, and in numerous forms are provided with tails or tail-like prolongations.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as in describing butterflies authors generally devote a good deal of
attention to the markings of the wings, it is important for the student to become
acquainted with the terms employed in designating the different parts of the wings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
(see <a href="#plate_b">Plate B</a>, Fig. 10). That part of the wing which is nearest to the thorax, is
called the  <em>base</em>; the middle third of the wing is known as the  <em>median</em> or  <em>discal area</em>;
the outer third as the  <em>external</em> or  <em>limbal area</em>. The anterior margin of the wing is
called the  <em>costal margin</em>; the outer edge is styled the  <em>external margin</em>; the inner
edge is known as the  <em>inner margin</em>. The tip of the front wing is called the  <em>apex</em>,
which may be rounded, acute, falcate (sickle-shaped), or square (see <a href="#plate_b">Plate B</a>,
Figs. 1-4). The angle formed by the outer margin of the front wing with the
inner margin is commonly known as the  <em>outer angle</em>. The corresponding angle
on the hind wing is known as the  <em>anal angle</em>, and the point of the hind wing,
which corresponds with the tip or apex of the fore wing, is designated as the  <em>external
angle</em>. The margins of wings may have different styles of outline, and are spoken
of as entire, crenulate, scalloped, waved, lobed, or tailed (see <a href="#plate_b">Plate B</a>, Figs. 5-8).</p>

<p>A knowledge of the veins which form the framework of the wings is important,
because authors have frequently established genera upon the basis of the wing
structure. It is desirable on this account to understand the nomenclature which
has been applied to the veins. This nomenclature is somewhat variant, different
writers having employed different terms to designate the same vein. In what follows
the writer has adopted the designations which are most current, and which are
generally accepted by authors. The best understanding of this matter is to be
derived from the attentive study of the diagrams given on <a href="#plate_b">Plate B</a>, Figs. 9 and 10.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
The veins in both the fore and hind wings of butterflies may be divided into simple
and compound veins. In the fore wing the simple veins are the  <em>costal</em>, the  <em>radials</em>,
the  <em>submedian</em>, and the  <em>internal</em>; in the hind wing they are the  <em>costal</em>, the  <em>subcostal</em>,
the  <em>radials</em>, the  <em>submedian</em>, and the  <em>internal</em>. The costal vein in the hind wing is,
however, generally provided near the base with a short ascending branch, which is
known as the  <em>precostal</em> vein. In addition to the simple veins there are in the fore
wing two branching veins, one immediately following the costal, known as the  <em>subcostal</em>,
and the other preceding the submedian, known as the  <em>median</em>. The branches
of these compound veins are known as  <em>nervules</em>. The median vein always has
three nervules. The nervules of the subcostal veins branch upwardly and outwardly
toward the costal margin and the apex of the fore wing. There are always
from four to five  <em>subcostal nervules</em>, variously arranged. In the hind wing the subcostal
is simple. The median vein in the hind wing has three nervules, as in the
fore wing. In both wings between the subcostal and the median veins toward the
base is enclosed the  <em>cell</em>, which may be either  <em>closed</em> or wholly or partially  <em>open</em> at its
outer extremity. The veinlets which close the cell are known as the discocellular
veins, of which there are normally three. From the point of union of these  <em>discocellular
veins</em> go forth the  <em>radials</em>, known respectively as  <em>upper</em> and  <em>lower</em>, though
the upper radial in many genera is emitted from the lower margin of the subcostal
vein.</p>

<p>Butterflies generally hold their wings erect when they are at rest, with their
upper surfaces facing each other, and only the under surfaces displaying their
colors to the eye. In the genus  <i lang="la">Ageronia</i> the insect prefers, like some moths, to
settle upon the bark of trees, with the wings spread flat, and the head pointing
downward. Many of the  <i lang="la">Hesperiidæ</i>, or “Skippers,” have the habit when they
are at rest of holding the fore wings folded together, while the hind wings are expanded
horizontally. Many of the butterflies known as “Hair-streaks,” belonging
to the genus  <i lang="la">Thecla</i> and its allies, have the curious habit, when at rest upon the end
of a twig or leaf, of moving their folded wings backward and forward, first on one
side and then on the other, thus partially displaying with each movement the splendid
blue surfaces of the upper side of the wings.</p>

<p>The abdomen of butterflies consists normally of nine segments (see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>,
Fig. <i>c</i>). In most butterflies except the Ithomiids, the end of the abdomen does not
extend beyond the anal angle of the hind wings. In the moths, on the other hand,
there are multitudes of genera in which the extremity of the abdomen extends far
beyond the hind margin of the posterior wings. This is particularly true of the
hawk-moths. A minute examination of the abdomen of a butterfly reveals in
each segment except the last a little valve-like orifice on either side. These openings
are known as  <em>spiracles</em> (see <a href="#plate_a">Plate A</a>, Fig. <i>c</i>). Through these the insect breathes.
Insects do not breathe through their mouths, like vertebrates, and their lungs, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
what correspond to the lungs of the higher animals, are not located in the thorax
or chest, but in the abdomen. The last segment of the abdomen carries at its extremity
the external organs of generation. The male may be distinguished from
the female by the so-called  <em>prehensores</em>, or “claspers,” two flattish, scale-like appendages
which adhere one on either side to the last segment of the body. These
organs are quite peculiar in their structure, and in recent years have received a great
deal of study, as it has been found possible by means of them to distinguish closely
allied species, especially among the  <i lang="la">Hesperiidæ</i>. It is, however, not possible within
our allotted space to go into a minute discussion of this matter. The abdomen of
the female is devoid of these appendages, and in this sex is generally heavier and
plumper, especially when the eggs, which fill the ovaries, have not as yet been deposited.</p>

<p>Thus far we have devoted our attention almost exclusively to the consideration
of the external organs of the suborder of insects which is under discussion. It may
be of interest to devote a few paragraphs to the internal anatomy of butterflies.
To do the subject full justice would require a volume; nevertheless some general
statements may pave the way for a more studious inquiry on the part of readers.</p>

<p>Butterflies take their nourishment in fluid form, principally from the cups
which Flora provides. The organ of ingestion is the proboscis, which communicates
with a bulb-like receptacle in the head, known as the pharyngeal sac, controlled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
by a set of muscles which cause it to alternately expand and contract, very
much like the bulb-syringe used by physicians. When the muscles expand a vacuum
is created, and the fluid is drawn up from the honeyed chalice of the flower
into the receptacle in the head; when they contract, a valve in front closes, a valve
behind opens, and the honey in the receptacle is forced backward through the
œsophagus into the crop, and thence into the stomach. The stomach lies on the
ventral or under side of the body, but above the nervous cord, which lies still more
ventrad. The stomach opens posteriorly into the small intestine, which is followed
by the colon, the latter in turn being succeeded by the rectum. Connected with
the intestines are certain vesicles, which are known as Malpighian vessels, and by
some are thought to have the function of the liver in higher animals.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly spoken of the nutritive system we may turn to the circulatory
and respiratory systems. The heart of a butterfly, as in all arthropods, lies
on the dorsal side of the body. Its location corresponds almost exactly to that
occupied in the vertebrate animals by the spinal cord. It is a long tubular organ.
It does not possess chambers—ventricles and auricles—such as are discovered in
the heart of vertebrates, but it has an enlargement in the mesothoracic region known
as the aortal chamber. The movement of the heart is wave-like, analogous to the
peristaltic movement in the intestines of the vertebrates. From the heart there go
out lateral blood-vessels, which ramify and intermingle with the capillary extremities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
of the tracheæ, or bronchial tubes, through which air is imported by way of
the spiracles, and thus the blood is purified in a manner quite analogous to that in
which the blood of the higher vertebrates is purified and freed from waste matter
by oxydization. The process is, however, as has already been pointed out, mainly
carried on in the abdominal region, and not exclusively in the thorax, as in the case
of vertebrates.</p>

<p>The nervous system of butterflies consists of a cord with  <em>ganglia</em>, or nerve-knots,
one for each segment of the body. As there are thirteen segments in the body of a
butterfly, there are normally thirteen such ganglia, or nerve centres. The nervous
cord lies in a position exactly opposite to that which is held by the spinal cord in
vertebrates. It is situated on the ventral side of the body, and more ventrad than
all the other internal organs. The ganglion in the head is the largest of all and
forms a rudimentary brain, the greater portion of which consists of two relatively
large optic nerves.</p>

<p>The internal organs of reproduction in the female consist of the ovaries, from
which the eggs pass by way of the oviduct to the ovipositor, which in butterflies is
not so conspicuous or remarkable an organ as is the case in many other insects.
Communicating with the oviduct are the spermatothecæ, which are receptacles in
which is retained the fertilizing fluid received from the male at the time of coition.
As the eggs, one by one, are passed from the ovaries into the oviduct, they are impregnated
through absorption of the spermatozoa, which enter their walls, imparting
to them vitality. The internal organs of the male are tubular vesicles, or testes,
which secrete the seminal fluid, which by means of the intromittent organ is introduced
into the spermatothecæ of the female. Union between the sexes among
insects generally takes place but once, and is not recurrent. The female, having
been impregnated, proceeds at once to lay her eggs upon the tender leaves or the
bark of the plants upon which her progeny are to be nourished, and then promptly
dies. The life of insects in the winged form is usually very brief. Inasmuch as
there are great differences between the sexes in insects alike in size, form, color, and
markings, it is well for the collector to carefully preserve specimens which may be
captured in copulation. Such specimens should be designated as “Taken  <i lang="la">in coitu</i>.”
The writer in such cases uses the formula “A ♂  <i lang="la">in coitu</i> with B ♀,” which is put in
minute handwriting upon a label and placed upon the pin bearing the male insect.
Upon the pin carrying the female insect there is put the label “B ♀  <i lang="la">in coitu</i> with
A ♂.” The finding of insects  <i lang="la">in copula</i> is sometimes the only way in which to definitely
settle the question of sexual relationship between forms. So different are
some insects that the two sexes have in a number of cases been described by early
writers as belonging not merely to different species, but to different genera, and
even families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_LIFE_HISTORY_OF_BUTTERFLIES">THE LIFE HISTORY OF BUTTERFLIES</h3>

<p>Almost all insects undergo great changes, or metamorphoses, during their
existence. Butterflies furnish no exception to this statement. They exist first
as  <em>eggs</em>; then they appear as  <em>caterpillars</em>; the third stage is that of the  <em>chrysalis</em>; the
final stage is that of the  <em>imago</em>, or perfectly developed insect.</p>


<h4>THE EGGS OF BUTTERFLIES</h4>

<p>The eggs of butterflies are beautiful objects when examined under a glass.
They have various forms. Some are spheres or half spheres, some are conical, cylindrical
or spindle-shaped, others are flat and resemble little cheeses, and still others
have the form of turbans. There is endless variety of form displayed within certain
limits. Their surfaces may be quite smooth or they may be adorned with raised
ribs and sculpturings (see <a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>, Figs.  <em>f</em> and <i>g</i>) or marked with little pittings or
depressions arranged in geometrical patterns. They vary in color. Some are
white, some pale green, or blue-green; others are yellow, orange, red, or purple.
They are often spotted and marbled like the eggs of some birds.</p>

<p>The eggs of butterflies are deposited by the female upon the plants which are
appropriate to the development of the larvæ. Caterpillars are very rarely promiscuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
feeders, and most species are restricted to certain species or genera of plants.
Even when they feed upon different plants, observation shows that, having begun
to feed upon a certain plant, they prefer this to all others, and do not willingly accept
anything else. I have noticed frequently that larvæ which may for instance
feed in nature upon the wild plum or the lilac, having begun to feed upon the one
will steadily refuse the other if offered to them. On several occasions I have lost
broods of caterpillars by attempting to change their diet, though knowing well that
the species is found feeding in nature upon the plants which I have offered to them.
Almost every plant has a butterfly or moth which is partial to it, and one of the
most wonderful things in nature is the way in which the female butterfly, without
having received a botanical education, is able to select the plant which will best
meet the needs of her progeny, which she never lives to see.</p>

<p>The eggs are deposited sometimes singly, sometimes in small clusters, sometimes
in a mass. Fertile eggs, soon after they have been laid, undergo a change in color,
and it is then possible with a magnifying glass to see through the thin shell the form
of the caterpillar which is being developed within.</p>

<p>When the development is completed the caterpillar emerges either from an
opening at the side or at the top of the egg. Many species have eggs provided with
a sort of lid, a portion of the shell being separated from the remainder by a thin
section, which finally breaks under the pressure of the enlarging embryo within,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
this portion flying off, the rest adhering to the twig or leaf upon which it has been
placed. Many larvæ have the habit, as soon as they have emerged from the egg,
of making their first meal upon the shell from which they have just escaped.</p>


<h4>CATERPILLARS</h4>

<p>The second stage in which the insects we are studying exist is known as the
 <em>larval stage</em>. When it is reached the insect is spoken of as a  <em>larva</em>, or  <em>caterpillar</em>
(see <a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>, Fig. <i>h</i>). Caterpillars have long, worm-like bodies, which are often
thickest about the middle, tapering before and behind, and more or less flattened on
the under side. Sometimes caterpillars are oval or slug-shaped. Very frequently
their bodies are adorned with hairs, spines, and tubercles of various forms. The
body of the larva, like the body of the butterfly, consists normally of thirteen rings
or segments, of which the three foremost, just behind the head, correspond to the
prothorax, the mesothorax, and the metathorax of the perfect insect, while the remaining
nine correspond to the abdomen of the imago. These three anterior segments
bear legs, which correspond to the legs of the winged form in their location,
and are known as the true legs of the larva. Besides these the caterpillar has about
the middle of the body and at its posterior end paired  <em>pro-legs</em>, as they are called,
which are its principal organs of locomotion in this stage, but which do not reappear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>in the butterfly. The mouth parts of caterpillars are profoundly different from
those of the butterfly. The imago lives, as we have seen, upon fluid nourishment,
and therefore is provided with a sucking organ, the proboscis. The caterpillar, on
the other hand, is armed with a pair of cutting mandibles, with which it shears off
tiny strips of the leaves upon which it feeds. It holds the edge of the leaf in place
with the three pairs of true legs, while it supports its body upon the pro-legs during
the act of eating.</p>

</figure>

<p>When the caterpillar emerges from the egg the head is in many cases seen to be
very large in proportion to the rest of the body. This relative disparity soon disappears,
however, as growth takes place. As the larva increases in size, it soon
reaches a point at which the skin in which it made its appearance in the world becomes
too small and tight for further comfort and use. Thereupon it proceeds to
moult, or shed, this now uncomfortable garment. The skin splits along the back
and the caterpillar crawls out of it. Before moulting the caterpillar always takes
the precaution to attach this outer skin by strands of silk to the leaf or branch
upon which the moult is to take place. Having escaped from the cast-off garment,
the caterpillar sometimes turns around and eats it before resuming its vegetable
diet. The process of moulting takes place four or five times before the larva
changes into a chrysalis.</p>

<p>Caterpillars differ entirely from butterflies in that they are able to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
silk. Silk is a viscous fluid secreted by elongated sacs located in the dorsal region.
These sacs communicate with a minute tube-like organ, known as the spinneret,
which is located on the under side of the head of the caterpillar, just back of the
mandibles. The fluid silk, as it is ejected through the spinneret, immediately
hardens on contact with the air and is deposited in the form of very fine threads or
filaments which the caterpillar uses for various purposes, sometimes as lines with
which to guide itself from place to place and enable it to retrace its steps to its
favorite resting-place, sometimes to tie together the leaves in which it forms its nest,
or to weave a sort of shelter in which it conceals itself, and finally to make the little
buttons and the girdles by which, as we shall see later, the chrysalis is held in
place. Many moths weave from silk compact structures known as cocoons, in
which the chrysalis is lodged. Butterflies do not weave true cocoons.</p>

<p>The time spent by the insect in the egg is generally short. The time passed in
the larval state may be short or long. When butterflies hibernate, or pass the
winter, as caterpillars, the time spent in this state is long, and especially in the case
of those species which inhabit arctic regions. There are some butterflies which
occur north of the Arctic Circle, and we have ascertained that these, because the
summers are so short in the far north, pass two summers and the intervening winter
in the larval condition, and another winter in the pupal stage, before they emerge
and take wing. On the other hand, under more temperate conditions butterflies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
certain species may produce two or even three broods in a summer, and in subtropical
or tropical lands there may be even more broods produced.</p>

<p>While it is true that almost all the larvæ of lepidoptera subsist upon vegetable
food, there are nevertheless exceptions, one of which is that of the Harvester,
 <i lang="la">Feniseca tarquinius</i> (see <a href="#b_plate_LXXXVIII">Plate LXXXVIII</a>, Fig. 1), the slug-like larva of which feeds
upon scale-insects, or mealy bugs, sharing the habit with certain allied species
which occur in Africa and Asia, as the writer has had occasion to point out a number
of years ago in certain of his writings.</p>


<h4>THE PUPA, OR CHRYSALIS</h4>

<p>The third stage in the life of lepidoptera is known as the pupal stage. The
caterpillar, having undergone successive moults and reached maturity, is transformed
into a pupa, or chrysalis (see <a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>, Figs. <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>). From having been
an active, worm-like creature, greedily feeding upon its appropriate food, it reverts
to a form which is stationary, as was the egg, and ceases to have the power of locomotion.
An examination of the structure of all chrysalids shows that they contain
an immature butterfly. The segments of the chrysalids enclose the corresponding
segments of the body of the butterfly, and in sheathing plates of chitinous matter
are enfolded the wings and all the other organs which are necessary to the life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the butterfly when it shall have emerged and taken wing. The act of transformation
from the caterpillar stage to the pupal stage is very wonderful. The caterpillar
makes provision for the great change by weaving a little button of silk and, in the
case of many of those larvæ, the chrysalids of which are not pendant, by also weaving
a little girdle of silk, which it passes around its back, and which holds it in place
very much as an Indian baby is held by the strap which passes over the shoulders
of the squaw (see <a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>, Fig. <i>e</i>). Having made these preliminary arrangements
the caterpillar becomes very quiet, its hind pro-legs being securely hooked
and tangled into the silken button to which it is attached. After a while, when the
proper moment has arrived, the skin of the caterpillar splits, just as in the moults
which preceded, and by a series of wriggling or vibratory motions the chrysalis
succeeds in working off the skin of the caterpillar until it has all been shed except
where near the end of the abdomen the skin is caught between the edges of two of
the horny rings which form the abdomen. Then the insect with the <i>cremaster</i>, as
it is called, a little spikelet at the very tip of the chrysalis, which is armed with
small hooks, proceeds to feel about until these hooks become entangled in the silk
of the button which has been provided on the under surface of the twig, the stone,
or the fence rail, where the transformation is occurring. As soon as the chrysalis
is securely hooked into the button of silk it lets go of the little section of the skin
by which it has been supported and rapidly assumes the shape in which it will remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
until the time of its emergence as a butterfly. These changes are illustrated on
<a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>, Figs. <i>a-d</i>, which are reproduced from “The Butterfly Book” after the drawings
of the late Prof. C. V. Riley. The chrysalids of all the Nymphalidæ are
pendant; those of the other families, except the Hesperiidæ, are provided with
girdles, as is shown on <a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>, in the figures which represent the chrysalis of
 <i lang="la">Papilio philenor</i>. The chrysalids of the Hesperiidæ, like the chrysalids of moths,
are either formed in loosely woven coverings of leaves tacked together with silken
threads, or lie free under leaves and rubbish upon the ground, thus resembling the
chrysalids of moths.</p>

<p>Chrysalids are for the most part rather obscure in coloring, though some are
quite brilliantly marked with metallic spots as in the case of the common Milkweed
Butterfly,  <i lang="la">Anosia plexippus</i>, the chrysalis of which is pearly green in color,
ornamented with bright golden spots.</p>

<p>The forms assumed by chrysalids are very various, especially among the
Nymphalidæ, and they are often ornamented with curious projections and tubercles,
imparting to them very odd outlines.</p>

<p>Some butterflies remain in the chrysalis stage for only a few days or weeks;
others pass the winter in this state, and this is true of many of the species which
are found in the colder parts of North America. In temperate regions some butterflies
have as many as three broods: the spring brood, which comes forth from chrysalids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
which have over-wintered, an early summer brood, and a fall brood. In
tropical countries many species retain the form of the chrysalis during the dry
season, and emerge upon the wing at the beginning of the rainy season, when vegetation
is refreshed and new and tender growths take place in the forests.</p>


<h4>THE IMAGO, OR WINGED INSECT</h4>

<p>We have already spoken at length of the form and structure of butterflies in
the preceding paragraphs, which were devoted to the anatomy of butterflies. It
remains for us at this point to call attention to the manner in which the butterfly
undergoes transformation from the chrysalis. This change is quite as interesting
as that which takes place when the caterpillar is transformed into the pupa; and
should any of my readers possess chrysalids I would advise them to watch carefully
and observe the curious events which follow one another rapidly when the imago
comes forth from the cerements of the chrysalis. The coverings which ensheathe
the head, the legs, and the antennæ split, the head protrudes, the fore legs are disentangled
and are thrown forth, followed almost at once by the other legs, and the
insect proceeds to crawl out from the pupal skin, emerging with the wings as miniature
objects, the body trailing after as a long worm-like mass. Having liberated
itself from the sheathings of the chrysalis, the insect immediately assumes a stationary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>position, head upward, body hanging downward. Then by the action of
the heart the fluids which fill the body begin to be rapidly sent into circulation,
more particularly into the wings, which expand second after second, minute after
minute, the fluids in the body being transferred through the circulatory system of
the wings until the latter, hanging downward, have assumed their full form. The
insect then begins gently to move its wings, to fan them, still remaining in the
position which it first took. After a while the wings become perfectly dry, and the
long worm-like body has shrunk up and has assumed the form which it will retain
through the subsequent life of the insect. Madame Butterfly then begins to
change her position. She carefully crawls a few steps to try her powers of locomotion.
She suddenly expands her wings, and,  <em>presto!</em> if you alarm her, she is off,
fluttering about the cage in which you may have her, or darting forth into the
room and through the open window, hieing herself forth in quest of food, which
awaits her in the honeyed cups of the wild flowers.</p>

<h3>COLLECTING BUTTERFLIES</h3>

<p>In collecting butterflies the first thing is to get a net of some kind with which
to catch the insects without tearing their delicate wings, and thus robbing them
of their beauty (see <a href="#plate_d">Plate D</a>, Figs. 1 and 2). When I was a boy I made my own nets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
I took a stick of tough wood about four feet long, which was to serve as the handle.
About seven or eight inches from the upper end I wrapped it with copper wire;
fishing line will do as well. Then I split the stick down to the band I had made
around it. I then with my knife trimmed the two split portions on their inner sides,
so that they might be more flexible. I then fashioned out of a piece of good green
hickory (the white outer wood must be used) a bow or hoop about twelve inches
wide at its widest part, and fitting this between the split ends of the stick put in a
wedge at the bottom of the cleft to keep the split ends well apart and tied it neatly
and securely in place. Upon the frame made in this way I put a covering of green
mosquito netting in the form of a long bag. Many a fine insect I captured with
this simple device, which called only for a good jack-knife, a little ingenuity, ordinary
skill in whittling, and a supply of stout string. The cheapest and simplest way
to make the frame for a net is to take a long piece of brass, aluminium, or galvanized
iron wire about an eighth of an inch in diameter and bend it into a circle, leaving
two short shanks at the end. Then fit the shanks into the top of the ferrule of a
fishing-rod plugged in the middle with a thin piece of cork or with clay, and pour
in melted solder. <a href="#plate_d">Plate D</a>, Fig. 3 shows how the “trick” is done.</p>

<p>There are many devices for making frames for folding nets, and there are a
number of dealers in the United States who supply such nets at moderate prices.
The material for the bag of the net ought to be of light stuff, and I prefer to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
tarletan, preferably green in color, or bobbinet. The latter is more durable though
somewhat heavier than tarletan. The bag of the net ought to be about three times
as long as the diameter of the ring upon which it is placed. It is well, after the net
has been sewed upon the ring, to cover it with a band of stout dark-colored muslin,
as otherwise the edge of the bag surrounding the ring is apt to become speedily
worn and torn.</p>

<p>The collector having provided himself with a net for capturing insects must
also provide himself with one or more collecting jars. It is well to have several of
these of a size convenient for carrying in the pockets. For large specimens a larger
jar is required; for small specimens a smaller receptacle is better. The larger jar
should have the mouth about two and one half or three inches in diameter. Wide-mouthed
glass phials an inch and a half in diameter serve best for the smaller receptacles.
The stopper of the larger jar should be of ground glass, of the smaller
jar of good cork. Jelly tumblers or glasses with tin tops make good collecting jars.
In preparing the jar for use place a few lumps of cyanide of potash about the size
of a filbert at the bottom; then put in a little clean sawdust to keep the pieces of
cyanide from rattling about; over the lumps of cyanide paste a sheet of strong white
paper perforated with a multitude of holes. In doing this the writer has resorted
to a simple method, which is explained in the diagram on <a href="#plate_d">Plate D</a>, Fig. 4. A piece
of paper is placed under the jar and a circle the size of the inside of the jar is traced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
upon it. Then a disk is cut out about three quarters of an inch greater in diameter
than the original circle. The paper is punctured over the entire surface included
within the inner line, and then with scissors little gashes are made from the outer
circumference inward, so as to permit of folding the edge of the disk inwardly. A
little gum tragacanth, or paste, is then applied to these upturned edges, the disk is
then inserted into the jar and pasted securely over the cyanide by means of the upturned
flaps. A jar thus charged will last for a long time if kept stoppered when
not in use. Cyanide has a tendency to liquefy in the presence of moisture, and it
is well therefore to take care to keep the jar closed when not in use. It must, however,
be borne in mind that the fumes of hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid), which
are active in producing the death of the insect, will not be given off in sufficient
volume unless there is a small amount of moisture in the jar, and in very dry climates
the writer has sometimes found it necessary to moisten the bottom of the jar
with a drop or two of water. Jars also may be charged with lumps of carbonate
of ammonia, but as this substance bleaches the wings of insects, especially those
which are green in color, its use is not strongly recommended. Figure 5 on <a href="#plate_d">Plate
D</a> shows a jar prepared for use.</p>

<p>When a butterfly has been caught in the net it is apt to flutter about and
struggle violently, thus injuring its wings. It is well therefore as soon as the insect
has been captured to take hold of it at the point where the wings join the body,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
while it is still in the net, and by gently pinching the thorax to disable the insect.
The fingers are applied from the outside, as shown in the illustration (see <a href="#plate_d">Plate D</a>, Fig.
1). Then the collector, unstoppering his jar, inserts it into the net and allows the butterfly
to drop into the jar. Butterflies belonging to the family of the  <i lang="la">Hesperiidæ</i>, or
“skippers,” are best captured in the net by holding up the end of the bag. The
insects will then fly upward and settle near the top of the bag. The collector puts
the open jar with his right hand into the ring of the net and holding the bag with
the left hand brings the jar under the butterfly, and then claps his left hand over
the mouth of the jar, thus securing the insect in the jar, where after a couple of
seconds it will be stunned by the fumes and fall to the bottom. Death is speedy,
but not instantaneous, and the insect should be allowed to remain a little while in
the jar. Having been asphyxiated by the fumes of the jar, the insect may then be
removed and either mounted upon a pin and transferred to a collecting box, which
will presently be described, or put into an envelope. It is well not to accumulate
too many insects in the collecting jar, as those which are caught later will injure
in their struggles those which have been caught first. I make it a rule to rapidly
transfer the insects from the collecting jars to the collecting boxes which I carry
with me. The preservation of specimens in perfect freshness, without torn or
ragged wings, is of the utmost importance, and it is better to take fewer specimens,
preserving them in immaculate condition, than to accumulate a quantity of ragged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
and battered examples. The old adage, “Practice makes perfect,” applies in the
use of the net and the poisoning jar. There will necessarily be some failures on
the part of the young collector at the outset, but if he is neat and quick of finger
he will soon acquire the art of taking and preserving perfect specimens.</p>

<p>The field box should be made of tin and should have a sheet of cork securely
fastened at the bottom. In one corner of the box, tied in gauze and securely
fixed in place, there should be a few lumps of cyanide. Into this box the specimens
should be pinned as they are taken from the collecting jar, and the lid
of this box should be kept tightly closed most of the time, being opened only
when the transfer of the pinned specimens to the interior of the box is ready to be
made. Inasmuch as pinning insects on the field is not always satisfactorily accomplished,
the writer prefers not to pin them, but to carry with him a supply of small
pay-roll envelopes, into which the insects are put, and these envelopes are then put
into a box which has some cyanide secured in it, as has already been described.
The writer also carries with him a little phial of chloroform in his vest pocket, and
he sometimes uses this to stun insects or puts a few drops into the collecting box
and then closes it. The objection to the use of chloroform is that it induces spasms
of the thoracic muscles, and butterflies killed by the use of chloroform are not
nearly so easily mounted as specimens which have been killed with cyanide. Beetles,
wasps, and other hard-bodied insects should not be put into the same collecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
jars as those which are used for butterflies, as they are very apt to injure
the latter, tearing and spoiling the wings. If the collector is engaged in taking
other insects besides butterflies and moths, he should have special jars in which to
put the beetles and other hard-bodied and spiny things.</p>

<p>If the collector does not wish immediately to mount his specimens, but to
preserve them for mounting at a future time, they may be left in the envelopes of
which I have spoken, or may be “papered.” The simplest way of putting up
butterflies in papers is to take an oblong piece of any kind of moderately good paper
and fold it as indicated in the diagram (see <a href="#plate_e">Plate E</a>, Fig. <i>b</i>), first folding on the
line a-b, then on a-d and c-b; then on the lines b-f and e-a, as marked in the diagram.
The result is the enclosure of the insect as shown in <a href="#plate_e">Plate E</a>, Fig. <i>c</i>. A
hundred or more of such envelopes may be put into an ordinary cigar box. Such
boxes, filled with butterflies, in order to prevent mould and the ravages of pests,
should have some chloroform or carbon bisulphide put into them and afterward a
spoonful or two of naphthaline crystals. Then they should be closed and sealed
up by pasting strips of paper over the edges. Butterflies thus collected on journeys
may be safely carried for long distances without injury, or even transmitted through
the mails provided the boxes are strong enough to resist crushing. When on
journeys the writer of these paragraphs always papers his specimens, bringing them
home to be later carefully mounted at his leisure. It is of the utmost importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to note on each envelope the place and the date of capture, so that these may later
be placed upon the little labels or tickets which are put upon the pins after the insects
have been expanded and mounted for display.</p>


<h3>MOUNTING BUTTERFLIES</h3>

<p>The writer cannot do better in dealing with this subject than to transfer from
“The Butterfly Book” the substance of the directions there given in relation to this
matter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the collector has time enough at his disposal he should at once mount
his specimens as they are intended to be displayed. The insect should first of all
be pinned. For this purpose “insect pins” should be used. These are made
either of soft steel or of pin metal. The first are to be preferred, except in very
damp climates, where they sometimes rust if they have not been properly enamelled
with shellac. The pin should be thrust perpendicularly through the thorax, midway
between the wings, and at a considerable elevation upon the pin. It should
then be placed upon the setting board or setting block. Setting boards or setting
blocks are pieces of wood having a groove on the upper surface of sufficient depth
to accommodate the body of the insect and to permit the wings to be brought to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>the level of the upper surface of the board 
(see <a href="#plate_d">Plate D</a>, Figs. 6 and 7; and <a href="#plate_e">Plate
E</a>, Figs. <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>). They should also be provided either with a cleft or a hole which
will permit the pin to be thrust down below the body of the insect for a considerable
distance. As a rule the wings of all specimens should be mounted at a uniform
elevation of about seven eighths of an inch above the point of the pin. This is
known as the “continental method” of mounting, and is infinitely preferable to
the old-fashioned “English method,” in which the insect was pinned low down
upon the pin, so that its wings touched the surface of the box.</p>

<p>Setting blocks are most advantageously employed in mounting small species,
especially the Hesperiidæ, the wings of which are apt to be refractory. When the
insect has been pinned upon the setting board or setting block, the next step is to
set the wings in the position which they are to maintain when the specimen is
thoroughly dry. This is accomplished by means of what are known as “setting
needles.” Setting needles may be easily made by simply sticking ordinary needles
into wooden matches from which the tips have been removed; steel insect pins will
serve as well. In drawing the wings into position, care should be taken to plant
the setting needle or pin behind the strong nervure on the costal margin of the wing;
otherwise the wings are liable to be torn and disfigured. The rule in setting lepidoptera
is to draw the anterior wing forward in such a manner that the hind margin
of this wing is at right angles to the axis of the body, the axis of the body being a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
line drawn through the head to the extremity of the abdomen. The hind wing
should then be moved forward, its anterior margin lying under the opposing margin
of the front wing. When the wings have thus been adjusted into the position which
they are to occupy, slips of tracing-muslin or of paper should be drawn over them
and securely pinned, the setting needles being removed.</p>

<p>In pinning down the strips which are to hold the wings in place, be careful
to pin around the wing, but never if possible through it. When the wings have
been adjusted in the position in which they are to remain, the antennæ should be
attended to and drawn forward on the same plane as the wings, and secured in place.
This may ordinarily be done by setting pins in such a position as to hold them where
they are to stay. Then the body, if it has a tendency to sag down at the end of
the abdomen, should be raised. This may also be accomplished by means of pins
thrust beneath on either side. <a href="#plate_e">Plate E</a>, Fig. <i>e</i>, shows clearly what is intended. When
the insect has been set, the board should be put aside in a place where it will not be
molested or attacked by pests, and the specimens upon it allowed to dry. A box
with shelves in it is often used for this purpose. This box should have a door at
the front covered with wire gauze, and the back should also be open, covered with
gauze, so as to allow a free circulation of air. A few balls of naphthaline placed in
it will tend to keep away mites and other pests. The time which the specimen
should remain on the board varies with its size and the condition of the atmosphere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Most butterflies and moths in dry weather will be sufficiently dried to permit of
their removal from the setting boards in a week; but large, stout-bodied moths may
require as much as two weeks, or even more time, before they are dry enough to be
taken off the boards. The process of drying may be hastened by placing the boards in
an oven, but the temperature of the oven must be quite low. If too much heat is applied
great injury is sure to result. Only a careful and expert operator should resort
to the use of the oven, a temperature above 120 F. being sure to work mischief.</p>

<p>When butterflies or moths have been put up in papers or mounted on pins without
having their wings expanded and set, it becomes necessary before setting them
to relax them. This may be accomplished in several ways. If the specimens have
been pinned it is best to place them on pieces of sheet-cork on a tray of sand which
has been thoroughly moistened and treated with a good dose of carbolic acid.
Over all a bell glass is put. A tight tin box will serve the same purpose, but a
broad sheet of bibulous paper should always be put over the box, under the lid
before closing it, and in such a way as to leave the edges of the paper projecting
around the edges of the lid. This is done to absorb the moisture which might settle
by condensation upon the lid and drop upon the specimens. In a bell glass the
moisture generally trickles down the sides. Earthenware crocks with closely fitting
lids are even better than tin boxes, but they must have paper put over them before
closing, in the same way as is done when tin boxes are used. When specimens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
have been preserved in papers or envelopes these should be opened a little and laid
upon damp, carbolized sand under a bell glass or in a closed receptacle of some kind.
Papered specimens may also be placed in their envelopes between clean towels,
which have been moistened in water to which a little carbolic acid has been added.
The towels should be wrung out quite dry before using them. Pieces of dampened
blotting paper are even better than towels. The method of placing between towels
should never be used in the case of very small and delicate species and those which
are blue or green in color. Great care must be exercised not to allow the insects to
become soaked or unduly wet. This ruins them. They should, however, be damp
enough to allow the wings and other organs to be freely moved. When the insects
have been relaxed they may be pinned and expanded on setting boards like freshly
caught specimens. It is well in setting the wings of relaxed specimens, after having
thrust the pin through the body, to take a small forceps and seizing the wings just
where they join the body gently move them so as to open them and make their
movement easy before pinning them upon the setting board. The skilful manipulator
in this way quickly ascertains whether they have been sufficiently relaxed to
admit of their being readily set. If discovered to be too stiff and liable to break
they must be still further relaxed. Dried specimens which have been relaxed and
then mounted generally require only a short time to dry again, and need rarely be
kept more than twenty-four hours upon the setting boards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p>The process of setting insects upon setting blocks is exactly the same as when
setting boards are used, with the simple difference that instead of pinning strips
of paper or tracing-muslin over the wings, the wings are held in place by threads
or very narrow tapes, which are wound around the block (see <a href="#plate_d">Plate D</a>, Figs 6 and 7).
When the wings are not covered with a very deep and velvety covering of scales
the threads or tapes may be used alone; but when the wings are thus clothed it becomes
necessary to put bits of paper or cardboard over the wings before wrapping
with the threads. Unless this is done the marks of the threads will be left upon
the wings. Some little skill, which is easily acquired by practice, is necessary in
order to employ setting blocks to advantage, but in the case of small species and
species which have refractory wings they are much to be preferred to the boards.</p>

<p>The work of mounting small insects which have been relaxed must be done
quite quickly and in a cool room or in a moist atmosphere. In a very dry and hot

<p>One of the best ways in which to secure perfect specimens is to breed them
from the caterpillar, or even from the egg. A stylish and very good cage for breeding
is shown on <a href="#plate_e">Plate E</a>, Fig. 2. As good a cage as this is not necessary, and the
collector will succeed with one or more clean store-boxes covered with a lid consisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
of a frame over which gauze or muslin has been stretched. The food-plant on
which the caterpillar feeds is kept fresh in bottles or jars. It is important, after
the plants have been put into the jar of water, to stuff around the stems cotton or
soft paper, so that the caterpillars may not crawl down and, falling into the water,
drown themselves. The bottom of the box may be filled to the depth of four or
five inches with loam and covered with dead forest leaves. The loam should not
be allowed to dry out thoroughly, but should be kept somewhat moist,  <em>not wet</em>.
A little sprinkling of water from time to time will suffice when done with care.
The caterpillars feed upon the food-plant, and finally undergo transformation in
the cage into the pupa, and eventually emerge as the butterfly or moth. The
breeding of lepidoptera in this way is a fascinating occupation for those who have
leisure to attend to it. For more minute instructions in reference to this matter
the reader is referred to “The Butterfly Book.” The caterpillars and chrysalids
themselves may be preserved in little phials, in alcohol or in a solution of formaldehyde.
The latter, however, is not to be recommended, because, although it
preserves colors better than alcohol, and does not tend to shrivel up the bodies, it
makes them stiff and difficult to handle and examine. The best way of preserving
caterpillars is to inflate them. Directions for doing this are contained in “The
Butterfly Book.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<h4 id="PRESERVATION">THE PRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF COLLECTIONS</h4>

<p>In order to preserve collections of lepidoptera in beautiful condition, light,
moisture, and insect pests must be excluded. Light bleaches many species, especially
those which are red, brown, or green in color. Moisture produces mold and
mildew. Insect pests such as mites,  <i lang="la">Anthrenus</i>, and  <i lang="la">Dermestes</i>, the two latter being
species of beetles, devour specimens. The receptacles containing collections should
therefore be furnished with covers excluding the light, kept in a dry place, and be so
tight that insect pests will not enter. However, as an additional precaution, it is
well to place in every box or drawer moth balls or lumps of camphor, secured so
that they cannot roll about. These tend to deter predaceous insects from entering
the receptacles. If by any chance they have entered, neither the naphthaline nor
the camphor in some cases will prevent their ravages. In the great collections
which are under the care of the writer it is a rule from time to time to go over all
the cases and put into every receptacle a small quantity of carbon bisulphide.
The fumes of carbon bisulphide kill all grubs and matured insects which may have
hidden themselves in the cases, and it is believed that it also tends to destroy the
life in eggs which may have been laid in the boxes. Great care should be used,
however, in employing carbon bisulphide, as the fumes mingled with the oxygen
of the atmosphere form an explosive compound. The work should never be done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
where there is danger of ignition from an open fire or light. Boxes for the preservation
of insect collections are made by many firms, and prices for such receptacles
vary according to their size and the materials employed in their construction.
All receptacles, however, should be lined at the bottom with cork or some other soft
material into which the pins sustaining the insects can be put. We employ in the
Carnegie Museum a composition cork covered with white paper, which is made in
sheets of varying sizes, according to requirement, by the Armstrong Cork Manufacturing
Company of Pittsburgh, Pa., the largest cork-manufacturing establishment
in the world. This is the most satisfactory material which is made.</p>

<p>Large collections are advantageously preserved in cabinets, the drawers of which
are covered with glass through which the insects may be inspected without handling
them. Here again, for the details of the construction of boxes, trays, and cabinets,
the reader is referred to “The Butterfly Book,” which may be found in every public
library, and is in the hands of multitudes of individuals.</p>

<p>In arranging specimens the scientific order should be followed. The species
belonging to a given genus should be placed together. The little labels attached
to the pins should give both the generic and the specific name, the locality where
the specimen was taken, and the sex, if known. For the purpose of designating
the sex naturalists employ what are known as “sex marks,” the male being indicated
by the sign of Mars, ♂, while the female is indicated by the sign of Venus, ♀.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
The inscription  <i lang="la">Papilio philenor</i>, ♀, means that the specimen is a male, and the
inscription  <i lang="la">Papilio philenor</i>, ♀, means that it is a female of the same species.</p>

<p>The classification of the genera and species should be subordinated further to
the classification into families. There are five families of butterflies represented in
the United States and Canada. They are the following:</p>


<ul><li>1. The Nymphalidæ, or “Brush-footed Butterflies.”</li>
<li>2. The Erycinidæ, or “Metal-marks.”</li>
<li>3. The Lycænidæ, or “Blues,” “Coppers,” and “Hair-streaks.”</li>
<li>4. The Papilionidæ, or the “Swallowtails” and their allies.</li>
<li>5. The Hesperiidæ, or the “Skippers.”</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">In every well-arranged collection of butterflies certain drawers or boxes should be
set apart for the reception of the insects belonging to these families, and they should
be placed under their proper genera, according to their species. Nothing is more
beautiful or interesting to those who have a love of nature than a collection of
butterflies thus classified and displayed.</p>

<p>In recent years an ingenious friend of mine has devised a system of mounting
butterflies under glass in cases made of a shell of plaster of paris, which he backs
with cardboard and seals around the edges with gummed paper. Latterly he has
taken to mounting them between pieces of glass which he secures in the same way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Specimens thus preserved keep well, may be handled readily without fear of injury
to them, and in the glass cases both sides of their wings may be examined. A
collection of butterflies mounted in this way may be stored in shallow trays and
placed in scientific order. The process of mounting in this fashion is, however,
somewhat laborious and expensive, and is not generally adopted by scientific men,
who wish to be free to examine their specimens under the magnifying glass, occasionally
touching the wings with benzine to disclose the facts of neuration, and to
minutely investigate the feet and other parts of the body, which, when sealed up
in the way I have described, are not easily accessible.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Having thus briefly outlined the principal facts as to the nature of butterflies
in general, and the best methods of collecting and preserving them, we now pass
on to the description of the commoner species which are found on the continent
of North America, north of Mexico and the Straits of Florida.</p>


<p class="center">
Class <span class="smcap">Insecta</span> (Insects)<br>

Suborder <span class="smcap">Rhopalocera</span> (Butterflies)<br>
Family <span class="smcap">Nymphalidæ</span> (The Brush-footed Butterflies)<br>
</p>

<p>The Nymphalidæ may be distinguished from all other butterflies by the fact
that  <em>in both sexes the foremost, or prothoracic, pair of legs is greatly dwarfed, useless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
for walking, and therefore carried folded up against the breast</em>. This is the largest of
all the families of butterflies and has been subdivided into many subfamilies.
Some of the genera are composed of small species, but most of them are made up of
large or medium-sized forms. To this family belong many of the most gorgeously
colored butterflies of the tropics, among them the brilliant blue  <i lang="la">Morphos</i> of equatorial
America.</p>

<p>The caterpillars, when they emerge from the egg, have heads much greater in
diameter than the rest of their bodies. In the earlier stages the bodies taper from
before backward, and are adorned with little wart-like protuberances, which bear
hairs. In later stages these little protuberances in many genera are replaced by
branching spines and fleshy projections, which impart to the caterpillars a forbidding
appearance. The mature caterpillar generally has a cylindrical body, but in
the subfamilies,  <i lang="la">Satyrinæ</i> and  <i lang="la">Morphinæ</i>, the larvæ are thicker at the middle, tapering
forward and backward.</p>

<p>The chrysalids, which are generally marked by metallic spots, always hang
suspended by the tail, except in the case of a few arctic species, which are found
under a frail covering composed of strands of silk woven about the roots of tufts of
grass, under which the larva takes shelter at the time of pupation.</p>

<p>In the region with which this booklet deals all the butterflies belonging to the
 <i lang="la">Nymphalidæ</i> fall naturally into one or the other of the following subfamilies: (1) the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
 <i lang="la">Euplœinæ</i>, or Euplœids; (2) the  <i lang="la">Ithomiinæ</i>, the Ithomiids; (3) the  <i lang="la">Heliconiinæ</i>, the
Heliconians; (4) the  <i lang="la">Nymphalinæ</i>, the Nymphs; (5) the  <i lang="la">Satyrinæ</i>, the Satyrs; (6)
the  <i lang="la">Libytheinæ</i>, the Snout-butterflies.</p>

<p>There are two species of this genus found in the United
States. The  <em>butterfly</em> has the cell of the fore wing closed by a
feeble veinlet and the cell of the hind wing open. The antennæ
and palpi resemble those of the genus  <i lang="la">Argynnis</i>. The
under sides of the wings are not spotted with silvery marks.</p>


<p>(1)  <i lang="la">Euptoieta claudia</i> (Cramer), The Variegated Fritillary.
<a href="#b_plate_VII">Plate VII</a>, Fig. 1, ♂; Fig. 2,  <em>under side</em>.</p>

<p>The caterpillar feeds upon the leaves of Passion-flowers and
violets. It is reddish yellow in color, with black spines on the
segments, white spots on the back, and dark brown bands
running the long way on the sides. The  <em>chrysalis</em> is pearly
white mottled with black spots and streaks. The insect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
ranges from southern New England south and west, and is
reported from as far north as Alberta. It goes as far as Argentina
in the south. Expanse ♂, 1.75 to 2.25 inches; ♀, 2.25
to 2.75 inches.</p>


<p>(2)  <i lang="la">Euptoieta hegesia</i> (Cramer), The Mexican Fritillary.</p>

<p>Very much like the preceding species, only the wings, especially
the hind wings, have very few dark markings, except
about the borders, and the insect is smaller. Expanse ♂, 1.6
to 2.25; ♀, 2.25 to 2.5 inches.</p>

<p>Found in Texas, Arizona, and southward.</p>

<p> <em>Butterflies</em> of medium or large size, generally of some shade
of reddish fulvous, conspicuously marked on the upper side
with dark spots and waved lines, which are less conspicuously
repeated on the under side, and in many species in part replaced
by silvery spots. In some species the males and the
females are  <em>dimorphic</em>, that is, very different in appearance
from each other. The palpi are strongly developed and
clothed heavily with hairs. The antennæ have a short, well-defined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
flattened, somewhat spoon-shaped club. The cells of
both fore and hind wings are closed.  <em>Eggs</em> cone-shaped, flattened,
and depressed at the top, rounded at the base, ribbed
both ways, mostly near the base.  <em>Caterpillars</em> dark in color,
spiny, with the spines on the first segment the longest; feeding
on violets at night, and hiding during the day.  <em>Chrysalis</em>
angular, adorned with more or less prominent projections,
head bifid.</p>

<p>This large genus has many species. It occurs in both
hemispheres. Its metropolis is North America, and we can
speak of only a few of the commoner and more conspicuous
forms.</p>


<p>(1)  <i lang="la">Argynnis idalia</i> (Drury), The Regal Fritillary. <a href="#b_plate_VIII">Plate
VIII</a>, ♂.</p>

<p>The figure given will help the student to recognize this insect.
The caterpillar, when fully grown, is about 1.75 inches in
length, black, banded and striped with ochreous and orange-red,
and ornamented with fleshy spines, of which the two rows
on the back are white tipped with black, those on the sides
black tinged with orange where they spring from the body.
The chrysalis is brown mottled with yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>This lovely insect is dimorphic, the male having the outer
borders of the wings orange-fulvous, while the female has the
wings bordered with blue spots. Expanse 3.75 to 4.5 inches.</p>

<p>It belongs to the southern Appalachian region, and ranges
from West Virginia and the Carolinas to northern Georgia,
thence westward to the Ozarks, being found sparingly in
southern Ohio and Indiana, and commonly in parts of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The male of this species is in some respects not unlike the
two following species, but with the wings darker at their bases;
the female, on the other hand, is quite different, the dark spots
on the inner half of the wings running together and giving this
part of the wings a dark brown or black appearance, while the
outer borders are pale yellow. Expanse 2.5 to 3.25 inches.</p>

(The Great Spangled Fritillary).</p>

<p>The male is bright reddish-fulvous on the upper side of the
wings, with the characteristic dark markings of the genus; on
the under side the wings are heavily silvered. There always
is a pale yellowish submarginal band shown on the under side
of the hind wings which does not appear in the next species,
and by the presence or absence of which they may be discriminated
from each other. The caterpillars hibernate as soon as
hatched, and pass the winter in this state, feeding up and maturing
in the following spring when the violets begin to grow.
Expanse 3 to 4 inches.</p>

<p>This species ranges from Maine to Nebraska and southward
to Georgia and Arkansas. It is our commonest species in the
Middle States.</p>

<p>Closely resembling the preceding species, but smaller. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
under side of the hind wings has the submarginal band narrower
than in  <i lang="la">A. cybele</i> and often wholly wanting, as shown in
the figure. The fore wings on the under side are redder at the
base than in  <i lang="la">A. cybele</i>. Expanse 3 to 3.5 inches.</p>

<p>The range is the same as that of the preceding species.</p>

<p>The two species  <i lang="la">A. cybele</i> and  <i lang="la">A. aphrodite</i> usually are
found flying at the same time and in the same places, and when
on the wing it is often very difficult to distinguish them from
each other. In fact they seem to intergrade into each other,
and in a long series of specimens such close resemblances often
occur that it is puzzling to decide which is which. The deeper
red of the fore wing of  <i lang="la">A. cybele</i> is the best diacritical character.
The paler outer margin of the hind wing of  <i lang="la">A. aphrodite</i>,
which is typically shown in <a href="#b_plate_XII">Plate XII</a>, sometimes occurs
also in  <i lang="la">A. cybele</i>, and I have specimens of the latter which
very closely approximate the former in this regard. In selecting
specimens for illustration I have chosen the two extreme
forms in which the pale wing of  <i lang="la">A. aphrodite</i> is seen to contrast
on the under side with the darker wing of  <i lang="la">A. cybele</i> shown on
<a href="#b_plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<p>It may be remarked in passing that the genus  <i lang="la">Argynnis</i> is
very difficult, and the writer has been in the habit of comparing
it to the genus  <i lang="la">Salix</i>, the willows, among flowers. Botanists
know how the willows seem to run together, and how hard
it is to discriminate the species. The same thing is true of
this great genus of butterflies with which we are now dealing.
It is particularly true of the species which occur in the region
of the Rocky Mountains, of which the writer has probably the
largest collection in existence, including all of the types of the
late William H. Edwards. The test of breeding has not been
fully applied as yet to all of these forms, and it is doubtful
whether some of them are more than varieties or local races.
There is here a field of inquiry which should tempt some young,
ardent, and careful student. The day for more thorough
work is at hand, and I hope some reader of these pages may
be converted to the task. Entomological study should become
more intensive, as well as extensive. The fathers of the science
have paved the way and laid foundations; it remains for the
rising generation to complete the work which the fathers have
begun.</p>

<p>The specimen figured on the Plate is the type of the male
contained in the collection of the late William H. Edwards.
Although taken long ago, it retains all its original freshness and
beauty.</p>

<p>There used to be near Cresson on the summit of the Allegheny
Mountains a field surrounded by woodland in which
violets grew. When the clover was in bloom myriads of
Fritillaries, belonging to the species  <i lang="la">aphrodite</i>,  <i lang="la">cybele</i>, and
 <i lang="la">atlantis</i>, congregated there. What captures we made! Many
a collection on both sides of the Atlantic contains specimens
taken in that field, but no possessor of these specimens can
have the happy memories of the days passed in that field by
their captor.</p>

<p>Abundant in southern California, according to W. G.
Wright, preferring plains, and being confined mainly to the
little hot valleys which traverse them. According to the same

<p>Many of the western species do not have the spots on the

One of these species, without silvery spots, the spots being
creamy white, without metallic lustre, is the beautiful insect
figured on <a href="#b_plate_XVI">Plate XVI</a>,  <i lang="la">A. rhodope</i>, the under side of the female
type of which we show. There are nearly a dozen species of

nervule; cells on both wings closed; palpi heavily scaled beneath.
Upper side of wings tawny, spotted with darker,
under side mimicking the color of bark and dead leaves, often
with a silvery spot about middle of hind wing. The butterflies
hibernate in winter.  <em>Eggs</em> taller than broad, tapering
toward top, which is flat, adorned with a few longitudinal
ribs, increasing in height upward, laid in clusters, or strung
together, then looking like beads.  <em>Larva</em> with squarish head;
body cylindrical, adorned with branching spines.  <em>Chrysalids</em>
with head bifid; prominent tubercle on back of thorax; two
rows of dorsal tubercles on abdomen; compressed laterally
in thoracic region; color wood-brown or greenish. The
caterpillars feed upon plants of the nettle tribe, including the
elm and hops, though willows, azalea, and wild currants are
affected by different species.</p>

<p>The genus is confined to the northern temperate zone. We

<p>The largest species of the genus in our fauna. Dimorphic,
the upper sides of the hind wings in the form  <i lang="la">fabricii</i> being
fulvous with dark markings, those of the form  <i lang="la">umbrosa</i> Lintner
being uniformly dark, except at base. In the Middle States
double-brooded. The second brood hibernates in the winged
form. Expanse 2.50 inches.</p>

<p>Found throughout Canada and the United States, except
on the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Grapta comma</i> (Harris), form <i>dryas</i>
 Edwards, <a href="#b_plate_XXVI">Plate XXVI</a>, ♂ (The Comma Butterfly).</p>

<p>Larvæ feed on nettles; some are almost snow-white. The
species is dimorphic. In the form  <i lang="la">dryas</i> Edwards the hind
wings are dark above, in the form  <i lang="la">harrisi</i> Edwards they are
lighter in color. Expanse 1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p>Readily recognized by the deep indentations of the hind
wings, the heavy black border, and the dark tints of the under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
side mottled conspicuously with paler shades. Expanse
2.00-2.15 inches. The larva feeds on willows.</p>

<p>Ranges from New England and Ontario to the Carolinas,
thence westward to the Pacific.</p>

<p>As I have remarked of the genus  <i lang="la">Argynnis</i> that it is difficult,
so also I may say of the genus  <i lang="la">Grapta</i> that it provokes much
discussion among those who have not had the opportunity
to study full series of specimens of the various species. The
resemblances are very great, and the differences are not accentuated,
so that the superficial observer is easily led astray.
The differences are, however, valid, even on the upper side
of the specimens, which are more nearly alike than the lower
side. Take the two species here presented to view on opposite
pages. They resemble each other closely, but the student
will soon see that there are differences, and these are constant.
On the under side they are very great,  <i lang="la">G. faunus</i> being light
in color below, while  <i lang="la">G. silenus</i> is very dark. In both species
at the end of the cell of the hind wing there is on the under
side a silvery spot which has the form of an inverted L (⅂),
or is rudely comma-shaped.</p>

<p>Wings in form very much like those of  <i lang="la">G. faunus</i>, but the
fore wing not as strongly produced at the ends of the upper
radial, and the hind wing at the end of the first submedian.
The wings are much darker below than in  <i lang="la">faunus</i>, without
large pale spots, at most sprinkled with white scales. Expanse
2.00-2.30 inches.</p>

<p>Occurs in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.</p>

<p>The life history of this species is not as yet known. It is
highly probable that the insect has the same tastes as the other
species of the genus, and lives upon much the same food-plants.
The late W. G. Wright, who was a careful observer, states that
the butterfly haunts partially wooded places upon hillsides in
the region where it is found. It is to be hoped that some
bright young person in Oregon or Washington may succeed in
breeding the larvæ to maturity, giving us an account of his
observations. It is a mistake to suppose that everything
which is worth knowing is already known about our lepidoptera.
There is much for the students of the future to find out.</p>

<p>Found at high elevations in the Appalachian highlands,
ranging northward to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, thence
westward to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast, its

<p>We all know Hunter’s Butterfly. How many know that its
name commemorates that of a most remarkable American,
John Dunn Hunter? Captured by the Indians in his infancy,
he never knew who his parents were. He was brought up
among the savages. Because of his prowess in the chase they
called him “The Hunter.” Later in life he took the name of
John Dunn, a man who had been kind to him. He grew up as
an Indian, but after he had taken his first scalp he forsook the
red men, no longer able to join them in their bloody schemes.
He went to Europe, amassed a competence, became the friend
of artists, men of letters, and scientists. He was a prime favorite
with the English nobility and with the King of England.
He interested himself in securing natural history collections
from America for certain of his acquaintances, and Fabricius
named the beautiful insect shown on our plate in his honor.
His <cite>Memoirs of Captivity Among the Indians</cite> are well worth
reading. In that charming book, <cite>Coke of Norfolk and His
Friends</cite>, which recently has been published, there are some
most interesting reminiscences of this American gentleman, for
gentleman he was, although reared by savages. The presumption
is established that his unknown progenitors were
gentlefolk. “Blood will tell.”</p>

somewhat falcate at apex, deeply excavated on outer margin;
hind wing greatly produced at the end of the third median

<p>The genus, which is quite large, reaches its greatest development
in the tropics of the Old World, and there is only one
species in the western hemisphere, which may have been introduced
in the old days of the slave trade. Most of the species
are mimics and the strange thing is that the mimicking form
is generally the female, which has the color and markings of
some one or other of the milkweed butterflies of the African
and oriental tropics. The female of our species patterns after
the markings of  <i lang="la">Danais chrysippus</i>, a common milkweed butterfly
of Africa. This adaptation of species to the form and
color of “protected” insects is of course not  <em>conscious</em>. It is the
result of a long evolution in past ages.</p>

<p>Occurs in Florida, the Antilles, and northern South America.
While very abundant in Africa, it seems to be scarce in the New
World. The female differs greatly from the male on the upper
side of the wings, but resembles that sex on the lower side.

<p>Rather large  <em>butterflies</em>. Fore wings subtriangular, rounded
at the apex, and lightly excavated on the lower two thirds of
the outer margin. Hind wings rounded, somewhat crenulate.
 <em>Egg</em> nearly spherical (see <a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>, Fig.  <em>f</em>) pitted with large
hexagonal cells. The  <em>caterpillar</em> in its mature state cylindrical,
with the second segment adorned with two prominent club-shaped
tubercles, and the fifth, ninth, and tenth segments also
having raised tubercles (see <a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>, Fig.  <em>h</em>). They feed upon
oaks, birches, willows, and lindens, preferably the two latter.
The caterpillars after hatching hibernate in little winter quarters,
which they make out of the fragment of a small leaf,
which they tie together with silken threads, and also secure
to the twig by a few strands. The  <em>chrysalis</em> has a projecting
boss on the back; the head is either rounded or slightly bifid.</p>

<p>There are a number of species in the United States, several
of which mimic other butterflies in a singular manner,  <i lang="la">B.
disippus</i> closely resembling  <i lang="la">Anosia plexippus</i>. The caterpillars
do not pupate until summer has come; the butterflies take
wing when the lindens bloom.</p>

<p>(1)  <i lang="la">Basilarchia astyanax</i> (Fabricius), <a href="#b_plate_XLIV">Plate XLIV</a>, ♀ (The

<p>Our figure gives a good idea of the upper side of the wings.
On the lower side the wings are brown, banded with black on
the margins, the inner row of marginal spots being red, with
two red spots at the base of the fore wings, and four such spots
at the base of the hind wings. Palpi white below; a white
stripe along the sides of the abdomen. Expanse 3.00-3.25
inches. The egg and caterpillar are shown on <a href="#plate_c">Plate C</a>. The
caterpillar is found on a variety of plants, but most commonly
on lindens, willows, and wild cherry trees.</p>

<p>Found all over the United States and Canada, as far west

the Gulf region. Is said to occur on the uplands of Mexico.</p>

<p>Between  <i lang="la">B. astyanax</i> and the following species,  <i lang="la">B. arthemis</i>,
there is more or less affinity. They represent two lines of evolution
from a common ancestry, and there are evidences of
atavic reversion to type constantly occurring in both forms.
They even occasionally interbreed with each other, and hybrids
are not altogether uncommon. The whole genus in fact
is in a more or less plastic state, and well deserves the careful
attention of biologists.</p>

<p>Our figure shows the upper side of the form which is most
usual. It will be seen that there are red spots on the hind
wings behind the white band. There is a variety called  <i lang="la">proserpina</i>
in which the white band becomes very narrow and the
red spots almost or entirely disappear. When the white band
and the red spots wholly disappear, as they sometimes do, it is
almost impossible to distinguish this species from  <i lang="la">B. astyanax</i>.
Expanse 2.50-2.75 inches. The egg has “kite-shaped” cells.
The caterpillar feeds on willows, hawthorns, and wild apple
and plum trees.</p>

<p>Medium-sized  <em>butterflies</em>. Front wings falcate at apex;
hind wings tailed at end of third median nervule. Costal
margin of fore wing angulated at base, inner margin straight.
Upper side of wings generally fulvous or red; lower side mottled
and marked so as to resemble dried leaves.  <em>Egg</em> spheroid,
flattened at base, depressed on top, marked with a few rows of
raised points about summit.  <em>Caterpillar</em> with head globular,
first segment behind it much smaller than head; body cylindrical
tapering behind.  <em>Chrysalis</em> short, stout, keeled on sides;
cremaster globular at tip, and so arranged as to cause the
chrysalis to hang at a slant.</p>

<p>This is a large genus characteristic of the American tropics.
The larvæ feed on euphorbiaceous and lauraceous plants, after
the third moult making hiding-places for themselves by rolling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
up leaves and tying them with silk. There are three species

<p>Medium or moderately large-sized butterflies. Costal and
subcostal fused near base; cells of both wings closed. Upper
side of wings curiously marked with checkered spots, generally
some shade of blue with white; under side with broad paler
shades: white, yellow, or red. They are rapid fliers, alight on
the trunks of trees head downward, wings expanded against
the bark of the tree. When they fly they make a clicking
sound with their wings. The manner in which this sound is
produced is a mystery. Bates in his <cite>A Naturalist on the Amazons</cite>
writes about it but gives no explanation. In my rambles
in tropical forests I have heard it as the insects gyrated above
my head, but I do not know how the sound is made.</p>

<p> <em>Butterflies</em> generally of medium size, obscure in color, their
wings, especially on the under side, ornamented with dark
eye-like spots, pupilled in the centre with a light point and
ringed around with one or more circles of lighter color. They
have a weak flight, dancing about in the herbage and often
hiding among grasses and weeds. Most of them are forest-loving,
but some live on the summits of bleak and cold mountains,
others on the verge of arctic snows, and some on the
prairies. Veins of the fore wings generally greatly swollen at
the base, thus enabling them to be distinguished from almost
all other butterflies.  <em>Eggs</em> subspherical, somewhat higher than
broad, ribbed on the sides, particularly at the apex, and
rounded at the base.  <em>Caterpillars</em>, when they emerge from the
egg, have their heads much bigger in diameter than the rest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the body, but as they mature they lose this feature, and generally
taper from the middle of the body in either direction.
Anal pro-legs bifurcating, thus readily distinguished from all
other caterpillars, except those of the genus  <i lang="la">Chlorippe</i>. They
feed upon grasses and sedges, concealing themselves in the daytime
and coming forth to feed at night.  <em>Chrysalids</em> short and
stout, plain both in color and outline.</p>

<p>There are about sixty species of  <i lang="la">Satyrinæ</i> in the region with
which this manual deals, falling into ten genera. We shall
only deal with the commoner species.</p>

by a waved, raised elevation.  <em>Caterpillar</em> with globular head,
cylindrical body, tapering both ways from the middle, and
furnished with diverging anal horns.  <em>Chrysalis</em> in form like
those of many of the genera belonging to this subfamily; green
in color. The genus is quite large, and many of the species
are very variable.</p>

a good species. Both fore and hind wings on the under

<p>Small  <em>butterflies</em>, the palpi enormously produced in comparison
with other butterflies. The fore wings are strongly excavated
on the outer margin, and produced at the end of the
lower radial. The hind wing is upwardly lobed at the base,
excised before the outer angle, and the outer margin is somewhat
scalloped. The  <em>egg</em> is ovoid, nearly twice as high as wide,
ribbed, every other rib being higher than the one beside it and
increasing in height toward the top. The  <em>caterpillar</em> has a
small head, overarched by the anterior swollen segments; it
lives upon the hackberry ( <i lang="la">Celtis</i>). The  <em>chrysalis</em> has the abdomen
conical, the head pointed, with two raised ridges running
from the head on either side to the middle of the first
segment of the abdomen; between these ridges is a low tubercle.</p>

<span class="smcap">Family ERYCINIDÆ</span><br>
 (<span class="smcap">The Metal-marks</span>).</h2>
</div>


<p>This is a great family of small or rather less than medium-sized butterflies, which is found
in both the eastern and western hemispheres, but is mostly confined to the American tropics,
where there are known to be about a thousand species, some of them remarkably beautiful in
their colors and markings. The males have the fore legs aborted as in the case of the  <i lang="la">Nymphalidæ</i>,
while the females have six legs for walking. In this respect they resemble the  <i lang="la">Lycænidæ</i>.
The chrysalids are not pendent as are those of all the insects which we have hitherto described
in this book, but are held in place by a silken girdle, and are closely appressed to the
supporting surface. The strongest mark of distinction from other butterflies is the fact that
the precostal vein of the hind wing is located on the extreme inner margin of the wing and
sends out a little free hook, very much as is the case in many of the moths. The antennæ are
very long and slender, distinctly knobbed at the end. Many genera have the peculiarity
when alighting of not folding their wings, but carrying them flat, and they have also the habit
of hiding under leaves, like moths. Most of the species found in our region occur in the Southwestern
States, two alone are found in the Eastern States.</p>

<p>Small  <em>butterflies</em>. The males have the first pair of legs more or less aborted, and not
adapted to walking. Many of the genera are brilliantly blue on the upper side of the wings,
others are coppery red. In Africa there are numerous genera which mimic other butterflies
in the form and color of their wings. The  <em>eggs</em> are turban-shaped adorned with ridges,
minute eminences, and networks of raised lines. Under the microscope some of them look
like sea-urchins after the spines have fallen off. The  <em>caterpillars</em> are slug-shaped, flat; and
while most of them feed on vegetable matter a few feed on scale-insects and aphids, and
some on the larvæ of ants. The latter are African and Oriental forms. The  <em>chrysalids</em> are
attached to the place where the caterpillar has pupated by a cincture or girdle.</p>

<p>The family is very large and is represented in all parts of the world, but there are probably
more species in the American tropics than in any other quarter of the globe, unless it be
in the Malaysian Archipelago and New Guinea, from which a host of species have been described
in recent years.</p>

<p>A multitude of refinements in classification have been invented by recent authors and a
lot of generic names have been proposed which in this book we shall in part ignore, as they
are based upon such slight points that nobody but a man armed with a big microscope can
make them out. They puzzle common people, and this book is for laymen and not for the
supertechnical.</p>

The genus in recent years has been subdivided into smaller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
subgenera but as an ability to discriminate these involves a knowledge of minuter anatomical
details, which is only possessed by specialists, the writer has not deemed it worth the while
in a little manual like this to go deeply into these matters. The old name  <i lang="la">Lycæna</i>, which has
been in vogue for a century, and which is still applied to part of the group, is sufficiently
characteristic. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: It">If</ins> we were reviewing all the species of the world, of which there are many

that is to say, it has a number of forms, some of which are seasonal,
some of which are sexual, some of which are climatic.
It is in fact only through the labors of the late William Henry
Edwards that some of the mysteries were cleared up, he having
by breeding established the fact that some of the so-called
species could be raised from eggs derived from one common
stock. The great series of specimens upon which his conclusions
were founded are in the possession of the writer, and have
from time to time been supplemented by a vast amount of
other material all of which confirms his teachings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<p>The forms  <i lang="la">lucia</i> and  <i lang="la">marginata</i> are winter forms, coming from chrysalids which have endured
the long cold of the winter months and are the first to appear in spring. They are the
only forms which occur in the far north near the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>The forms  <i lang="la">pseudargiolus</i> and  <i lang="la">neglecta</i> are summer forms of the second and third generations,
produced from eggs laid by  <i lang="la">lucia</i> and  <i lang="la">marginata</i>.  <i lang="la">Nigra</i> is a dimorphic female form belonging
to the summer broods and is melanic; that is to say, it is a form in which dark color
prevails. Students of biology recognize a tendency in some animals to become black, while
there is also a tendency to become white, or to produce albinoes. These tendencies in opposite
directions in color are often observed in butterflies, and the melanic female of the
species under consideration illustrates it. There is still another form,  <i lang="la">piasus</i>, which occurs
in Arizona and Mexico, and is climatic, or due to the influence of environment.</p>

<p>The winter forms are dwarfed and darkly marked on the under side as our figures show;
the summer forms are larger, pale on the under side and dark on the outer borders above.</p>

<p>The species has a range in the expanse of wing of from 0.85-1.25 inch.</p>

<p>It occurs from Alaska to Florida, and from Anticosti to northern Mexico.</p>

by a flat disk-like expansion; vertically and horizontally ribbed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
<i>Caterpillars</i> elongated; head small; body generally green, striped
longitudinally. They feed upon leguminous plants, and
especially upon the various species of clover (<i>Trifolium</i>) and
 <i lang="la">Astragalus</i>, though some boreal species are known to feed upon
the foliage of huckleberries ( <i lang="la">Vaccinium</i>) and willows.</p>

<p>The genus is large and is found on every continent except
Australia. It is lacking in the very hot tropical regions of
both the New and Old Worlds, but is found in Greenland and
thence ranging south among the cordilleran uplifts to Patagonia.
It is represented from Japan to Norway, and turns up
at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>This is the common “Puddle-butterfly” or “Clover-butterfly”
which every child has seen gathered in swarms about
moist places, or hovering by the score or hundreds over the
blossoming clover fields. There are many variations both in
size and color. The females are frequently albinoes, that is
to say they are white, rather than yellow. Now and then
melanic males turn up, but they are rare. In these the wings
are black, of the same color as the borders in normal specimens.

<p>This peculiar group of butterflies is classed with the Papilionidæ
because the internal vein of the hind wings is always
wanting, a characteristic of all papilionine genera. The caterpillars
are not provided with osmateria, or offensive scent-organs,
and pupation takes place upon the ground among
loosely scattered leaves which are interwoven by the larva
with a few loose strands of silk. The insects are mainly inhabitants
of the mountain regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>This butterfly and the three which follow belong to a group
of the genus which in England is represented by  <i lang="la">P. machaon</i>
of the fens of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. There are many
species evidently derived in past time from common stock,
which are found in America, and the writer believes that
the original centre of dispersion was this continent, and that the
English Swallow-tail represents the most western range of the
migration, which probably began in Tertiary times, when
the horse, the camel, and other North American animals passed
over into Asia and became subsequently extinct in the land
of their origin.  <i lang="la">P. machaon</i> still exists in Alaska as the variety
 <i lang="la">P. aliaska</i> Scudder.</p>

<p> <i lang="la">P. polyxenes</i>, more commonly known by its later name  <i lang="la">P.
asterius</i>, or  <i lang="la">P. asterias</i>, is found all over the Atlantic States
and the Mississippi Valley. The caterpillar feeds upon

<p>This is the sole representant in our fauna of a great group of
splendid butterflies peculiar to the tropics of the New World,
which are true papilionids, but without tails, their wings
generally of some shade of green, and wonderfully adorned
with spots of other colors, generally yellow or crimson. It may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
easily be recognized from our figure. Expanse 3.00-3.50

<p>It is found in the extreme southern part of Florida and on
the adjoining reefs. It also has a wide range through the
Antilles, Mexico, and Central America.</p>

<p>Generally quite small <i>butterflies</i>, with stout thorax. Both
sexes have six feet adapted to walking. Tibiæ of hind legs,
with few exceptions, have spurs. Lower radial of hind wing
in many genera wanting, being represented by a fold in the
wing. <i>Eggs</i> hemispherical, flat on base. <i>Larvæ</i> cylindrical
tapering from the middle before and behind, with large globular
heads, smooth. <i>Chrysalids</i> generally formed on the ground or
among leaves and rubbish lightly tacked together with a few
strands of silk, in which the cremaster is caught.</p>

<p>A large family, most numerously represented in the tropics
of both the Old and New Worlds. About three thousand
species are known, of which over one hundred occur within our
limits.</p>

<p>The male never has a costal fold on the fore wing, but in
most of the genera has a discal stigma on the fore wing, the
only exceptions to this in our fauna being in the case of the
three genera  <i lang="la">Amblyscirtes</i>,  <i lang="la">Pamphila</i>, and  <i lang="la">Oarisma</i>. The
antennæ are short, in some genera very short, clubbed at the
end and provided in many genera with a little finely pointed
tip at the end of the club, which sometimes is bent backward.
The third joint of the palpi is generally small, inconspicuous,
and often pointing forward. The lower radial in the fore wing
always is nearer to the median than to the upper radial; the
lower radial in the hind wing is generally lacking. When at
rest they raise the fore wings, folding them together, while the
hind wings are held horizontally. This attitude is characteristic
of this subfamily.</p>

<p>These curious insects have been by some writers placed among the  <i lang="la">Castniidæ</i>, a family
of day-flying moths, but as the author stated in 1898 in “The Butterfly Book,” they appear
to have much more in common with the Hesperiidæ than the Castniidæ. The proposition
to include them in the Hesperiidæ as a subfamily under the name given above has since
that time been generally accepted by systematists. There are a number of species belonging
to the genus  <i lang="la">Megathymus</i>, several of which occur within our faunal limits, but we shall content<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>

 <p class="center bold">By Dr. W. J. HOLLAND</p>
<br>
<p class="fs135 drop-capx">This book on American butterflies,
 by Dr. W. J. Holland, has introduced 
thousands of readers to the delightful study of butterflies
and their development. Its 48 color plates are the best which have
been produced by the three-color process. In these and the text cuts are
shown more than five hundred different species. Dr. Holland’s collection
of these insects is the best in the United States, barring none, and he has
throughout used his own specimens in preparing the plates. Chapters
showing how to collect and preserve butterflies add greatly to the value
of the book. It contains 382 text pages, 10 pages of index.</p>
<br>
<p class="fs135">Attractively bound in green cloth, decorated in gold. Size of
volume 7 × 10.</p>

<p class="center fs250 bold">THE MOTH BOOK</p>

 <p class="center bold">By Dr. W. J. HOLLAND</p>

<p class="fs135 drop-capy">This book serves as an introduction to the study of moths, but the
student who has fully mastered the contents is as far advanced in
his studies as are many men who were a few years ago regarded as
eminent specialists. It is the standard reference book of North America
on the subject.</p>

<p class="fs135">Dr. Holland, Director of the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, is one of
the leading entomologists of the country and has had more experience in
mounting and artistically posing moths and butterflies than any other
living man.</p>

<p class="fs135">There are 1,500 figures in the color plates and 300 text cuts illustrating
1,800 species of the moths of North America. This volume is the most
complete on the subject which has thus far appeared, and contains 479
pages. Size 7 × 10.</p>

<p class="center fs175 bold">THE BIRD BOOK</p>

 <p class="center bold">By CHESTER A. REED, B. S.</p>
<p class="drop-capy fs115">Mr. Reed’s new bird book is the most complete guide he has yet made. Unlike the
pocket guides which though ideal for field work, cannot because of their size give all the
details the student wishes, this book is a whole reference library about birds and their
haunts. It contains illustrations in colors of more than seven hundred birds of all
varieties from all parts of the country which show the birds more than an inch in height
so that every detail of real life is faithfully reproduced. In addition to these illustrations
in color there are many hundreds more showing the eggs in life size, and numerous unusual
photographs of birds in flight and in their natural haunts.</p>


<p class="bold center wsp fs115">More than 700 illustrations in color and many unusual Bird Photographs. Net, $3.00</p>

<p class="center fs175 bold">THE TREE GUIDE</p>

 <p class="center"><span class="bold">By JULIA ELLEN ROGERS</span>  <em>Author of “The Tree Book”</em></p>

<p class="drop-capy fs115">The Tree Guide is uniform in style and size with the well known pocket Bird Guides
which have become so universally popular. It contains illustrations and descriptions of
the trees of the country. The descriptions include the range, the classification, the distinctive
features such as flowers, leaves, fruit, etc., and all other marks that lead to an easy
identification of the tree. An ideal volume for expert naturalist or amateur for field work or
even more exhaustive study.</p>

<p class="bold center wsp fs115">32 illustrations in color; many in black and white. Cloth, net, $1.00 Leather, net, $1.25</p>

be given whole.</p>

<p class="center fs175 bold lsp">AMERICAN GAME BIRDS</p>
</div>
 <p class="center bold wsp">By CHESTER A. REED, B. S.</p>


<p class="drop-capy fs115">Certain species and families of our wild birds are classed as game and can,
at certain seasons, be legally hunted for sport or for food. A great number
of books have been written for sportsmen and by sportsmen, most of them
containing but a very few black and white illustrations of some of the species mentioned.
As far as we know, AMERICAN GAME BIRDS is the  <em>only</em> sportsman’s
book illustrating nearly all of these birds in NATURAL COLORS. With it, the
novice can identify any game bird he secures or sees, and the old-timer, as well,
can see just what sportsmen in other sections of the country are shooting. The
illustrations are excellent reproductions by the very best process from water-color
paintings made directly from the birds.</p>

<p class="fs115">The text portrays their habits just as truly as the pictures do their appearance,
and the two together give the reader a correct impression of each species, such as
can be gained in no other way except by long association with the birds. Mr. Reed
knows birds as few others do, and has hunted, studied and photographed them from
Labrador to Florida, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>

<p class="fs115">More than 100 species illustrated in natural colors.</p>


<p class="center bold fs115">In handsome Paper Covers, 60c. net; postage, 5c.</p>
